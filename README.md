## Introduction

In this project, we analyze the sales data of a pizza store to extract actionable insights that can help optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth. By diving into different metrics such as total revenue, pizzas sold, sales trends, and top-selling items, we aim to provide valuable information for decision-making and strategy development.

## Data

The data used for this analysis is stored in the `Tableau Project 1` directory. It includes:

- `pizza_sales_excel_file.csv`: A detailed dataset containing information about each sale, including date, time, items purchased, quantities, and total amount.

## Analysis

We conduct the following analyses on the sales data:

- **Total Revenue**: Calculating the overall revenue generated by the pizza store.
- **Total Pizzas Sold**: Determining the total number of pizzas sold during the analyzed period.
- **Hourly Trends**: Analyzing the hourly trends for total pizzas sold to identify peak hours of sales activity.
- **Weekly Trends**: Examining the weekly trends for total hours, total orders, and total pizzas sold to understand sales patterns over the week.
- **Sales by Category**: Investigating the distribution of total orders and pizzas sold by category (e.g., cheese, pepperoni, vegetarian).
- **Pizza Size Distribution**: Calculating the percentage of sales by pizza size and category to understand customer preferences.
- **Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue**: Identifying the top 5 pizzas based on revenue generated.
- **Top 5 Pizzas Sold by Quantity**: Determining the top 5 pizzas sold based on the quantity sold.

## Results

The analysis yields the following insights:

- Total revenue and pizzas sold during the analyzed period.
